# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
At Pewlett Hackard, a large number of employees seemed to be nearing retirement age.
An analysis was conducted to plan for the retirement of eligible employees at Pewlett Hackard.
The analysis aimed to answer the questions of who would be retiring in the next few years and how many positions will need to be filled.
Although the employee data provided was in six different .csv files, an employee database was created using Postgres and SQL to generate a list of all Pewlett Hackard employees eligible for the retirement package. Using this employee database, the number of retiring employees per title and employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program were determined.

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
